**nissutils** is a collection of code and utilities for working with Nissan ECU ROMs from roughly 2000-2017 but newer may also work to some extent.

This is the product of **thousands** of hours of research and work.
The code (unless otherwise specified) is licensed under GPLv3 which has certain restrictions. Here is a short summary:

(emphasis mine. Source: https://tldrlegal.com/license/gnu-general-public-license-v3-(gpl-3) )

You may copy, distribute and modify the software as long as you track changes/dates in source files.
Any modifications to or **software including (via compiler) GPL-licensed code** must also be made available under the GPL along with build & install instructions.


Commercial uses is possible, but **all code linked with GPL 3.0 source code must be disclosed under a GPL 3.0 compatible license.**

If you find all or parts of **nissutils** useful, please consider a donation, whatever the amount. That is a great way to motivate me to continue adding to, and improving these tools.

I accept donations through paypal (email me first), or other methods on request @fenugrec @users.sourceforge.net or nisprog @gmail..com
