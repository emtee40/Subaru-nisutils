Nissan / generic SH-based ROM loader for Ghidra

GPLv3

This script is mainly designed for Nissan ECU ROMs but can be useful on other ROMs based on one of these :
- SH7050, SH7051
- SH7052, SH7054
- SH7055
- SH7058
- SH7059
- SH72531 (limited)
- SH72543 (limited)

In "full auto" mode (only works for Nissan ROM dumps), this script will determine the correct CPU and define
- memory areas
- interrupt vectors, including split vector tables if applicable
- IO peripheral registers

In "basic" mode, useful for generic or unknown ROMs, the script will prompt for a device type and define
- memory areas
- basic interrupt vectors
- IO peripheral registers


The raw data for vectors and registers are stored in .csv files.
Feel free to expand or improve this, PR's are more than welcome.
